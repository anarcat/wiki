OpenPOWER
=========

IBM has loaned to the OSUOSL a cluster of OpenPOWER machines that have KVM
capability enabled on them. These are development machines and are not available
for any use other than to support FOSS.

These machines are intended to run Openstack in a cluster fashion powered by
KVM.
