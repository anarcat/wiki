OpenStack (x86_64, POWER, & AARCH64)
====================================

This wiki provides resources to deploy and manage instances on our Openstack clusters.

We curently have 3 OpenStack clusters at the OSL: x86_64, POWER, and AARCH64. The x86 cluster is used
typically for production hosting while the other two are mainly used to support development and CI
for those architectures. All 3 clusters run Openstack powered by KVM.
